\subsubsection*{Goals} 

The book provides a practical introduction to the use of mathematical
modeling and statistical computing techniques to solve decision
problems that arise in various industrial settings. Examples are drawn
from manufacturing, finance, sports, healthcare, retail,
transportation, and other areas. In realistic settings, proficiency
with mathematical and statistical computing software is required to
solve these problems. We use the algebraic modeling language GAMS for
solving mathematical programming problems and we use the R programming
language for obtaining answers to statistical computing problems;
however, the methodologies that are developed stand on their own and
the book can be used with other programming langauges. GAMS code and
listings are provided via github in the gams/ directory. R code,
output, and discussion are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks
in the src/ directory. The github repository for the book is
\url{https://github.com/bx549/IPPM}.  We hope that students as well as
practicing engineers and analysts will find the book to be useful.

\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}

I want to acknowledge the following undergraduate students in the
Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering who created content
and checked solutions to end-of-chapter exercises.  Hannah Kleist
created scenarios for deterministic optimization problems in Chapter 1
and implemented solutions in GAMS. She also created content for
exercises on stochastic processes in chapter 2. Emily Sayles created
content for end-of-chapter exercises on deterministic inventory models
in chapter 1, probabilistic inventory models in chapter 2, and
decision problems in chapter 3. Braeden Greseth created content and
implemented solutions in R for exercises in chapters 2, 4, and 5.
